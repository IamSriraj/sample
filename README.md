# Sample work/examples using React.js

I would like to cover one or few examples depending on the time. Also I would like to explain few basics.
  
## Scripts

All scripts are run with `npm run [script]`, for example: `npm run test`.

* `build` - generate a minified build to public folder
* `dev` - start development server, try it by opening `http://localhost:8080/`
* `test` - run all tests
* `test:unit` - run all unit tests
* `test:unit:live` - continuously run unit tests watching for changes
